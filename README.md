Group Event Board App for final project week at CC. 


Final Project Brief


Objective

Messaging groups are messy, especially those that are used to organise events. You always need to scroll back through chat nonsense to find key dates, addresses and times. 

My brief is to create an event board web app that multiple users can use to organise group events, can leave messages and share content. The group chat is present but most importantly, the group events are segregated, organised and presented in chronological order.


MVP

Use rails to set up an active record database to store users, groups and events.
Allow users to add events to the group.
Many users can be part of the group.
Each user can add events to the group.
Allow user authentication that controls what the user can see.


Extensions

Add user authorisation to users to control their group access (“can can” authorisation Ruby gem).
Users can create groups.
Users can have many groups.
User can add message to the group.
Add Google map API to event to show planned routes.
*Add Strava API so that user can select from their own previous routes.
Implement weather API to show conditions for an upcoming event.
